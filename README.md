This is the Udacity Flashcards project. The react native application allows users to create multiple decks of flashcards and quiz themselves on the cards they create.

This project consists of views/screens to:

* View list of created decks
* Create a new deck
* View an individual deck
* Quiz yourself
* Create a card for the deck

This app was tested for Android devices using the Expo XDE.

To run with Expo, open the folder in the Expo XDE and click "Run on Android." Your device (or simulator) must be connected in some way, such as tethered or across the network.
